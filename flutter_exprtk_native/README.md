# flutter_exprtk_native

The Windows implementation of [`flutter_exprtk`][1].

## Usage

### Import the package

This package has been endorsed, meaning that you only need to add `flutter_exprtk`
as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`. It will be automatically included in your app
when you depend on `package:flutter_exprtk`.

This is what the above means to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  flutter_exprtk: ^0.0.7
  ...
```

If you wish to use the Windows package only, you can add `flutter_exprtk_native` as a
dependency:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  flutter_exprtk_native: ^0.0.7
  ...
```
